All resourcepacks and assets used here belong to their respective owners. I'm going to be asking for permission on as much of this stuff as I can before actually releasing the pack, so most of the stuff here is subject to change.

Planned adjustments:

-Add Intricate Survival resources (permission given)
-Port over various optifine exclusives (waiting on this because I've been having issues with alternatives)
